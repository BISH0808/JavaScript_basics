        "* Set up a data source: Decide on a data source for your app, such as an API or a database. Use libraries like Axios to interact with your data source.\n",
        "* Design your dashboard: Plan out the layout and functionality of your dashboard. Decide on the components you'll need to build, such as tables, charts, and forms.\n",
        "* Implement the dashboard: Use the UI framework and React components to build your dashboard. Use React Router to manage navigation between different pages and components.\n",
        "* Test your app: Test your app to make sure it works as expected. Use tools like Jest and Enzyme to write unit tests and integration tests.\n",
        "* Deploy your app: Choose a hosting provider for your app, such as Heroku, Netlify, or AWS. Use a tool like Git to deploy your app to the hosting provider.\n",

        "These are the general steps involved in building and deploying a React Admin Dashboard App. Keep in mind that there may be additional steps or variations depending on your specific needs and requirements."

        "To manipulate data using React.js and MongoDB, you'll need to follow a specific approach. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Set up a React.js project: Start by creating a new React.js project using tools like Create React App or any other preferred method.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Connect to MongoDB: Install the MongoDB Node.js driver (mongodb) in your React.js project using npm or yarn. This package allows you to interact with MongoDB from your Node.js code.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Establish a connection: Create a module to establish a connection to your MongoDB database. In this module, use the mongodb package to create a connection to your MongoDB instance by providing the connection URL and any required authentication credentials.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Define MongoDB schema: Decide on the structure and schema of your data in MongoDB. This step involves defining the collections and fields you'll be working with.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Create React components: Create React components that will handle data manipulation. For example, you might have a form component for adding new data, a table component for displaying existing data, and an edit component for modifying data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Perform CRUD operations: Within your React components, use asynchronous functions to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the MongoDB database.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Create: Implement functionality to add new data to the database. Capture user input from the form, and upon submission, call a function that sends the data to the server to be inserted into the MongoDB collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Read: Fetch existing data from MongoDB to display it in your React components. Use queries to retrieve specific data from the MongoDB collection, and update the component's state with the retrieved data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Update: Allow users to modify existing data. Implement functionality that allows users to edit specific fields and update the changes in the MongoDB collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Delete: Enable users to delete data from the database. Implement a function that triggers the deletion of a specific document from the MongoDB collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Handle errors and loading states: Implement error handling and loading states to provide better user experience. Display loading indicators while waiting for responses from the MongoDB server, and handle any errors that might occur during data manipulation operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Test and debug: Thoroughly test your application to ensure that data manipulation operations work as expected. Use the browser console and server logs to debug any issues that arise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember to follow best practices for security, such as validating user input, protecting against injection attacks, and implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms when working with user data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, it's worth noting that performing direct MongoDB operations from client-side code like React.js is generally not recommended for security reasons. A more common approach is to create a server-side API (using Node.js or another backend technology) that interacts with the MongoDB database and exposes endpoints for your React.js client to communicate with. This helps protect your database credentials and adds an extra layer of security"

When the button is clicked, it sends an HTTP GET request to 'https://api.test.online/' using Axios. If the request is successful, it retrieves the firstName property from the response data and updates the quote state with that value. The retrieved quote is then displayed below the button. If there is an error during the request, the error is logged to the console."
